               <h2>Orcs</h2>
               <p>The orcs originally resided on the world of Draenor. Unfortunately, The Burning Legion made use of them in an attempt to conquer Azerothâ€”they were infected with the daemonic blood of Mannoroth the Destructor, driven mad, and turned upon both the Draenei and the denizens of Azeroth. After losing the Second War, they were cut off from the corrupting influence of Mannoroth, and began to return to their shamanistic roots. Now, under the leadership of their new Warchief, the orcs are carving out a home for themselves in Azeroth.</p>
               
               <h2>Tauren</h2>
               <p>The tauren, a race with deep shamanistic roots, are longtime residents of Kalimdor. They have a deep and abiding love of nature, and the vast majority of them worship a deity known as the Earth Mother.<br>
               The Tauren are huge, bestial creatures who live in the grassy, open barrens of central Kalimdor. They live to serve nature and maintain the balance between the wild things of the land and the restless spirit of the elements. Despite their enormous size and brute strength, the remarkably peaceful Tauren cultivate a quiet, tribal society. However, when roused by conflict, Tauren are implacable enemies who will use every ounce of their strength to smash their enemies under hoof.</p>
               
               <h2>Trolls</h2>
               <p>While there are many different tribes of trolls scattered across Azeroth, only the Darkspear Tribe has ever sworn allegiance to the Horde. The trolls originally lived in the Broken Isles, but were overrun by naga and murlocs and driven from their home. The orcs, led by Thrall, saved the Darkspear tribe from certain destruction and offered them amnesty among the Horde. In return, the Darkspear tribe swore fealty to the orcish warchief.</p>
               
               <h2>Undead</h2>
               <p>When the undead scourge initially swept across Azeroth, they converted a number of members of the Alliance to the undead. When the combined forces of the orcs, elves, trolls, dwarves and humans began to fight back, though, The Lich King's hold on his forces began to weaken. A small faction of humans, known as the Forsaken, broke free of the Lich King's control.</p>
